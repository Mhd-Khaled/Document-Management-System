# Document-Management-System

This Project is a Document Management System.
Its database of almost empty. It has only a department with name admin and a user who is the adminstrator of this department.
you have to know the username and the password for that administrator
the username : "ab"
the password : "073"
use the username and the password above to access the system as admin and then add departments,Users,Documents according to your needs.

I hope this project might help somebody.
Thanks and have a nice day.
